# API Suite (Coming Soon)

<div class="cyber-box">
API SYSTEM: DEVELOPING<br/>
INTEGRATION: SEAMLESS<br/>
REVENUE: 100% TO LP<br/>
PRIVACY: PRESERVED
</div>

A robust API suite is under development to enable developers and platforms to integrate CLOAKED functionality into their own systems. Revenue generated through API usage (e.g., API call fees, licensing, etc.) will be routed **entirely to the $CLOAK token liquidity pool**, further strengthening token value. Benefits include:

<div class="cyber-box">

**▶ Expanded real-world utility for CLOAKED Protocol**

**▶ Enhanced liquidity via B2B integrations**

**▶ Aligned growth between protocol adoption and token strength**

**▶ Enables anonymous implementation of CLOAKED within external platforms**

</div>

The API will include endpoints for transfer initiation, address cloaking, metadata obfuscation, and traffic masking—empowering developers to build privacy-first apps and systems.
