# Transfer Fee Structure & Liquidity Integration

<div class="cyber-box">
FEE STRUCTURE: OPTIMIZED<br/>
RATE: 0.1%<br/>
DESTINATION: 100% TO LP<br/>
TRANSPARENCY: MAXIMUM
</div>

Each cross-chain transfer conducted via the CLOAKED Protocol incurs a nominal fee of 0.1% of the transferred amount. This fee is not extracted for profit—instead, **100% of the fees are automatically rolled into the token's native liquidity pool (LP)**. This model achieves:

<div class="cyber-box">

**▶ Continuous reinforcement of $CLOAK liquidity**

**▶ Incentivizes users to hold their funds in $CLOAK as a hedge**

**▶ Aligned economic incentives between users and the protocol**

**▶ Organic growth of the $CLOAK ecosystem through usage**

</div>

All fee-based liquidity additions occur through **autonomous smart contracts**—fully transparent, **anonymously verifiable**, and resistant to manipulation. The LP contract address will be made public once CLOAKED is live.
