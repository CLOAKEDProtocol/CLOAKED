CLOAKED Protocol will soon introduce a powerful staking mechanism that enables holders of $CLOAK to lock tokens for yield and governance benefits. Key features include:

<div class="cyber-box">

**▶ Weekly Unlock Schedule**  
Rewards are distributed in weekly epochs, avoiding inflation shocks and encouraging longer participation.

**▶ Deflationary Pressure**  
Partial fees from staking-related activities may be burned or redistributed to LP, pending governance approval.

**▶ Privacy-Aligned Staking**  
Stake positions may be anonymized using zk-commitments, ensuring your participation remains **obfuscated and anonymous**.

</div>

Staking empowers users to not only earn yield, but to do so **without compromising their privacy**—a uniquely CLOAKED experience.
