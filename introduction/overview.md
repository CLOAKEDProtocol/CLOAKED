# Introduction

Privacy has always been a cornerstone of decentralized finance, yet most cross-chain operations today expose user activity to surveillance and analysis. CLOAKED Protocol redefines this paradigm by integrating advanced AI for **multi-layered obfuscation**, on-chain pattern disruption, and zero-knowledge-based interoperability, creating a secure and **anonymous** digital asset transfer experience. It provides all of this while ensuring DECENTRALIZATION on both the Protocol level AND the token level giving life to a protocol that can truly empower users. CLOAKED Protocol goes into live beta one week from the token launch, ushering in a new era of untraceable and frictionless blockchain interoperability.
