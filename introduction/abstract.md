# Abstract

CLOAKED Protocol is an advanced AI-powered privacy framework designed to enable seamless, **undetectable and anonymous** cross-chain asset transfers. In an increasingly surveilled and fragmented blockchain ecosystem, privacy and interoperability have become critical issues. CLOAKED addresses these with a proprietary, next-generation protocol that ensures **total user anonymity** through dynamic obfuscation while enabling trustless movement of assets across chains.
