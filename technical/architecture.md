STATUS: OPERATIONAL
</div>

The CLOAKED Protocol architecture combines multiple layers of advanced technologies:

<div class="cyber-box">

**▶ AI-Based Obfuscation Engine**  
Utilizes adversarial neural networks to generate unpredictable and untraceable asset routing paths.

**▶ Cross-Chain zkProof Relay (CZR)**  
A multi-layer ZK relay mechanism that generates proof bundles abstracted from transaction origin, destination, and intent.

**▶ Decentralized Privacy Mesh (DPM)**  
A mesh network of privacy-preserving nodes that route transactions through homomorphic encryption layers.

**▶ Entropy Injection Layer (EIL)**  
Dynamically inserts randomized data packets to disrupt traffic pattern analysis.

**▶ Mimic Protocol™**  
Transfers mimic typical smart contract interactions across chains to avoid heuristic detection.

**▶ Self-Adaptive Obfuscation (SAO)**  
The protocol evolves based on threat landscape using on-chain feedback and off-chain machine learning models.

</div>

Together, these systems deliver an end-to-end **obfuscation stack** that is not only decentralized and permissionless but actively resists surveillance, forensic analysis, and data correlation attempts.
